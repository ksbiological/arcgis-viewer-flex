This folder contains KBS' documentation for our customized version of Esri's ArcGIS Viewer for Flex.

If you make changes and want to republish the documentation, copy this folder onto an Linux machine that has Sphinx installed, change into this directory, and run:

    sudo make latexpdf

The final document, as a PDF, will be located at '_build/latex/kbs-map-viewer.pdf'.

For more information about Sphinx, see http://sphinx-doc.org/.
